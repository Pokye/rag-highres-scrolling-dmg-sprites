# What is this project ?
It combines my love for RO with one of my hobbies which is tinkering with vector graphics.

I've always thought the original damage font looked ugly because it was rasterised at a very low resolution then converted to sprites and the game then scaled it using a bilinear filter.

The company responsible for making RO never changed these sprites so now in 2022 when blown up on a decently big screen they look awful!

The project aims to provide high resolution sprites of a variety of popular/cool/interesting fonts using true-to-RO color gradients.

# Format
Sprite format BGRA32 was chosen for its superior graphical fidelity.

If BGRA32 sprites crash your game convert them to Indexed8.

Slightly modified ACT are available for convenience if you want the original animations. They have been adjusted for the higher sprite resolution.
