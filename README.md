# What is this project ?
It combines my love for Ragnarok Online with one of my hobbies which is tinkering with vector graphics.

I've always thought the original damage font looked ugly, and Gravity (the makers of the game) never changed it so now in 2022 when blown up on a 1080p screen (or bigger) it looks awful!

The project aims to provide high resolution replacements using faithful color gradients.

# Format
Sprite format BGRA32 was selected for its superior graphical fidelity.

If BGRA32 crashes your game convert each sprite to Indexed8.
